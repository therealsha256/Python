# Python

this is my first attempt at building a blockchain. 

this Blockchain does have the capabilities to mine/record txs/review the chain/resolve conflict/register other nodes. 

You can copy/paste the code to your editor and run 'py list' on your console to see the list of dependencies, the 'Python install' to get you going. 

please feel free to send your feedback, comments etc. 

thanks for visiting this repository, don't forget to say hello!
